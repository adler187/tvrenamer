# Renamer2.rb
# Version 2.3
# Copyright 2007 Kevin Adler
# License: GPL v2
# Changelog

# Version 2.3.3
# Added support for 3 digit episode numbers to support all of Colbert Report eps
# This does not work if the name is a straight number ala Charmed 804.avi because that
# would cause too much guesstimation on my part (is it a 2 digit season and 2 digit episode
# or 1 digit season and 3 digit episode?)

# Version 2.3.2
# Fixed it so that it actually reads and uses the third parameter in the shows.txt, not sure what happened there
# Fixed the url.chomp! being in the wrong place so that it sometimes tries to call on nil, causing Exception
#  (How many times have I fixed that already and I keep losing the changes?)

# Version 2.3.1
# Fixed bug where the renamer assumes that the extension is 3 characters

# Version 2.3
# Added ability to individually retrieve episode and title from a filename
# for instance from: incite-chappelles.show.s01.e01.proper.dvdrip.xvid

# Version 2.2.5
# Fixed bug with wrong variable name @shows_files_exists -> @show_exists

# Version 2.2.4

# Fixed bug with program exiting after episode not found on epguides.
# Fixed bug with not being able to match show name, now we remove the extention before trying to match,
#	I dont exactly know how it was even matching before.

# Version 2.2.3

# Fixed some errors with files named show.s#e##.avi

# Version 2.2.2

# Removed some debug output

# Version 2.2.1

#  shows.txt should work just fine now on windows and linux!

# Version 2.2.1a
# Test to see if shows.txt will be found on windows. Apparently you can not use the shell variable like I was using it,
# if you are in the C directory, it will point to C:\Documents..\Username\ because the shell variable actually points to
# \Documents..\Username and the C: gets prepended to it because you are browsing the C: directory. So what we do is
# open up cmd.exe, echo the variable and then grab the output and use a full path: C:(output from cmd.exe). Since I don't
# have windows available for testing at this time, it is not 100% guaranteed to work.

# Version 2.2
# -No more rename.txt! This functionality is now built in to shows.txt, first is the input title <tab> epguides name <tab> renamed name

# Version 2.1.2
# -Fixed rename.txt not being found on windows. Since windows is dumb and %Homepath% does not include the drive
#  letter, we include "C:" before %HOMEPATH%

# Version 2.1.1
# -Fixed hack for "The 4400" remember, !show.downcase() == "the" is not the same as show.downcase() != "the"
# -Also fixed problems with show.SSEE.avi or show.SEE.avi filters, remember ruby array slices are inclusive on
#	first number, but exclusive on last number UNLESS last number is end of array => switched to ranges instead to avoid errors again

# Version 2.1

# New and improved! Now with Versioning!

# renames files such as
# Gilmore Girls s01e13 - Concert Interruptus.avi
# Farscape [1x01] - Premiere.avi
# Arrested.Development.3x07.avi
# Mork.and.Mindy.S01E03.avi
# Lost.S3E21.avi
# Gilmore Girls - 503 - Written in the Stars.avi
#
# to Show Name-Season Number without Trailing 0-Episode Number with Trailing 0-Episode Title.extension

# ini.rb - read and write ini files
#
# Copyright (C) 2007 Jeena Paradies
# License: GPL
# Author: Jeena Paradies (info@jeenaparadies.net)
#
# == Overview
#
# This file provides a read-wite handling for ini files.
# The data of a ini file is represented by a object which
# is populated with strings.

class Ini

# Class with methods to read from and write into ini files.
#
# A ini file is a text file in a specific format,
# it may include several fields which are sparated by
# field headlines which are enclosured by "[]".
# Each field may include several key-value pairs.
#
# Each key-value pair is represented by one line and
# the value is sparated from the key by a "=".
#
# == Examples
#
# === Example ini file
#
#   # this is the first comment which will be saved in the comment attribute
#   mail=info@example.com
#   domain=example.com # this is a comment which will not be saved
#   [database]
#   db=example
#   user=john
#   passwd=very-secure
#   host=localhost
#   # this is another comment
#   [filepaths]
#   tmp=/tmp/example
#   lib=/home/john/projects/example/lib
#   htdocs=/home/john/projects/example/htdocs
#   [ texts ]
#   wellcome=Wellcome on my new website!
#   Website description = This is only a example. # and another comment
#
# === Example object
#
#   A Ini#comment stores:
#   "this is the first comment which will be saved in the comment attribute"
#
#   A Ini object stores:
#
#   {
#    "mail" => "info@example.com",
#    "domain" => "example.com",
#    "database" => {
#     "db" => "example",
#     "user" => "john",
#     "passwd" => "very-secure",
#     "host" => "localhost"
#    },
#    "filepaths" => {
#     "tmp" => "/tmp/example",
#     "lib" => "/home/john/projects/example/lib",
#     "htdocs" => "/home/john/projects/example/htdocs"
#    }
#    "texts" => {
#     "wellcome" => "Wellcome on my new website!",
#     "Website description" => "This is only a example."
#    }
#   }
#
# As you can see this module gets rid of all comments, linebreaks
# and unnecessary spaces at the beginning and the end of each
# field headline, key or value.
#
# === Using the object
#
# Using the object is stright forward:
#
#   ini = Ini.new("path/settings.ini")
#   ini["mail"] = "info@example.com"
#   ini["filepaths"] = { "tmp" => "/tmp/example" }
#   ini.comment = "This is\na comment"
#   puts ini["filepaths"]["tmp"]
#   # => /tmp/example
#   ini.write()
