Version 3.1.3
Fixed bug where date was being read as the production code (The Oblongs > ep 10, date is "UNAIRED")

Version 3.1.2
Fixed bug where it would not use ini settings

Version 3.1.1
On windows, since it is most likely be ran by double click, the user will not be able to see any output, so we 
prompt them to end the program.
Also changed version information in file to reflect minor version 3.1

Version 3.1
Added overwrite command line option
Added ability to rename shows by air date instead of season/episode number, use renamebydate = true in the ini file

Version 3.0.2
Fixed bug if the page load encounters an error. It handles the error, but just prints out a warning and continues.
This resulted in an error when trying to access code member of a nil object. Instead we print out the message and
return nil. Also, returns the response code if it is not 200 (success) instead of if it is 404. Checks for not 404
and displays the error.

Version 3.0.1
Fixed bug with moving command line argument handling causing a missing 'end'

Version 3.0
Replaced shows.txt with shows.ini.
Added support to get the production code and air date
Added support for custom renaming masks
Added support for custom date formats for air date
Added support for per show custom masks and dates

Version 2.3.3
Added support for 3 digit episode numbers to support all of Colbert Report eps
This does not work if the name is a straight number ala Charmed 804.avi because that
would cause too much guesstimation on my part (is it a 2 digit season and 2 digit episode
or 1 digit season and 3 digit episode?)

Version 2.3.2
Fixed it so that it actually reads and uses the third parameter in the shows.txt, not sure what happened there
Fixed the url.chomp! being in the wrong place so that it sometimes tries to call on nil, causing Exception
(How many times have I fixed that already and I keep losing the changes?)

Version 2.3.1
Fixed bug where the renamer assumes that the extension is 3 characters

Version 2.3
Added ability to individually retrieve episode and title from a filename
for instance from: incite-chappelles.show.s01.e01.proper.dvdrip.xvid

Version 2.2.5
Fixed bug with wrong variable name @shows_files_exists -> @show_exists

Version 2.2.4

Fixed bug with program exiting after episode not found on epguides.
Fixed bug with not being able to match show name, now we remove the extention before trying to match,
#	I dont exactly know how it was even matching before.

Version 2.2.3

Fixed some errors with files named show.s#e##.avi

Version 2.2.2

Removed some debug output

Version 2.2.1

shows.txt should work just fine now on windows and linux!

Version 2.2.1a
Test to see if shows.txt will be found on windows. Apparently you can not use the shell variable like I was using it,
if you are in the C directory, it will point to C:\Documents..\Username\ because the shell variable actually points to
\Documents..\Username and the C: gets prepended to it because you are browsing the C: directory. So what we do is
open up cmd.exe, echo the variable and then grab the output and use a full path: C:(output from cmd.exe). Since I don't
have windows available for testing at this time, it is not 100% guaranteed to work.

Version 2.2
-No more rename.txt! This functionality is now built in to shows.txt, first is the input title <tab> epguides name <tab> renamed name

Version 2.1.2
-Fixed rename.txt not being found on windows. Since windows is dumb and %Homepath% does not include the drive
letter, we include "C:" before %HOMEPATH%

Version 2.1.1
-Fixed hack for "The 4400" remember, !show.downcase() == "the" is not the same as show.downcase() != "the"
-Also fixed problems with show.SSEE.avi or show.SEE.avi filters, remember ruby array slices are inclusive on
#	first number, but exclusive on last number UNLESS last number is end of array => switched to ranges instead to avoid errors again

Version 2.1

New and improved! Now with Versioning!
